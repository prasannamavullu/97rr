         <P style="color: darkgreen;">Couldn’t stand seeing yourself as a failure in front of your parents
            Avoiding your friends as they would boast about their new jobs
            Fearing you will end in a poorly-paid graduate job that you’ll never like
            Wondering how you will compete in the off-campus fresher recruitment race
            Getting angry when your relatives show up
            Constantly plagued by the question, “What will I do next?”</P>
